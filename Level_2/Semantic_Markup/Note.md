Semantic markup in HTML uses tags that describe the meaning of content rather than just its presentation, making web pages more understandable for both humans and machines (like search engines and screen readers). 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

What it is:
Semantic HTML focuses on using HTML elements that clearly define the purpose and structure of the content within a webpage, rather than relying on generic tags like <div> or <span>. 

Why it's important:
Improved Accessibility: Semantic HTML helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the context and structure of web pages, making them easier for users with disabilities to navigate and consume. 
Better SEO: Search engines rely on the structure and meaning of web pages to understand the content. Semantic HTML helps search engines index and rank pages more effectively. 
Easier Maintenance and Collaboration: Semantic HTML makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the structure of a webpage, as the meaning of the content is clearly defined. 
Separation of Concerns: Semantic HTML encourages a separation between the structure (HTML) and the presentation (CSS), making it easier to modify the look and feel of a webpage without affecting its structure. 

Examples of Semantic HTML Elements:

<header>: Represents the introductory content of a page or section. 
<nav>: Contains navigation links. 
<article>: Represents a self-contained composition, like a blog post or news article. 
<aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the main content, like a sidebar. 
<main>: Represents the main content of the page. 
<footer>: Contains the footer content of a page or section. 
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content. 
<table>: Represents tabular data. 
<p>: Represents a paragraph. 
<h1> - <h6>: Represents headings. 
<ul> and <ol>: Represents unordered and ordered lists. 

Non-Semantic Elements:
Elements like <div> and <span> don't provide any semantic meaning and are generally used for styling or grouping content. 

HTML5 and Semantic HTML:
HTML5 introduced a range of new semantic elements to make it easier to describe the structure and meaning of web pages.
